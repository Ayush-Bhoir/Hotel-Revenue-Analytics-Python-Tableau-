# 🏨 Hotel Revenue Analytics – Data Cleaning & Tableau Dashboard Project

📌 Summary
An end-to-end data analytics project focused on analyzing hotel revenue, booking behavior, and cancellation patterns to support better revenue management decisions. The project involves cleaning raw hotel booking data using Python, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building an interactive Tableau dashboard to deliver actionable revenue insights for the hospitality domain.

🎯 Objective
- Clean and preprocess raw hotel booking data using Python
- Analyze revenue drivers such as ADR, booking volume, and cancellations
- Identify seasonal trends and pricing patterns impacting revenue
- Compare revenue performance across hotel types (City vs. Resort)
- Build an interactive Tableau dashboard for revenue-focused decision-making

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
- Loaded raw hotel bookings CSV into pandas
- Handled missing values in guest, country, agent, and company fields
- Standardized date-related columns and stay duration fields
- Corrected data types for revenue-related metrics such as ADR and nights stayed
- Engineered features like total stay duration and estimated booking revenue
- Prepared a clean, analysis-ready dataset for downstream analysis

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Analyzed canceled vs. non-canceled bookings and their revenue impact
- Compared revenue and cancellation behavior between City and Resort hotels
- Studied monthly and seasonal revenue trends
- Analyzed ADR trends over time to understand pricing behavior
- Identified countries contributing the highest canceled revenue
- Generated visual insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

📝 Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end hotel revenue analytics workflow using Python and Tableau. Raw hotel booking data was cleaned and transformed in Python to ensure data quality and consistency. Exploratory data analysis was then conducted to uncover revenue patterns, cancellation impacts, and pricing trends. The final Tableau dashboard presents these insights through interactive visuals, enabling stakeholders to make informed revenue management and operational decisions.
